[[sse_introduction]]
=== Introduction

Server-sent events (SSE) is a specification originally introduced as
part of HTML5 by the W3C, but is currently maintained by the WHATWG
<<bib17>>. It provides a way to establish a one-way
channel from a server to a client. The connection is long running: it is
re-used for multiple events sent from the server, yet it is still based
on the HTTP protocol. Clients request the opening of an SSE connection
by using the special media type `text/event-stream` in the `Accept`
header.

Events are structured and contain several fields, namely, `event`,
`data`, `id`, `retry` and `comment`. SSE is a messaging protocol where
the `event` field corresponds to a topic, and where the `id` field can
be used to validate event order and guarantee continuity. If a
connection is interrupted for any reason, the `id` can be sent in a
request header for a server to re-play past events â€”although this is an
optional behavior that may not be supported by all implementations.
Event payloads are conveyed in the `data` field and must be in text
format; `retry` is used to control re-connects and finally `comment` is
a general purpose field that can also be used to keep connections alive.
