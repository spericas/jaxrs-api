[[changes-since-2.0-early-draft]]
=== Changes Since 2.0 Early Draft

* <<project_team>>: Updated 2.0 expert group member list.
* <<acks>>: Updated acknowledgements for 2.0 version.
* <<exceptions_providers>>: New section that describes exception
handling for all providers. Related changes to reference this new
section.
* <<exceptions_filters_and_interceptors>>: New section for filter
and interceptor exceptions. Related changes to reference this new
section.
* <<request_matching>>: Updated step 2a so that it only goes to
step 3 when latexmath:[$M \neq \{\}$].
* <<request_matching>>: New sentence about the use of a server
quality parameter (qs-value) during request matching.
* Chapter <<filters_and_interceptors>>: New extension point for pre-match
filters that are executed before resource matching.
* Chapter <<filters_and_interceptors>>: Filter methods no longer return a
next action; the execution of a request filter chain is stopped by
setting a response in the associated context.
* Chapter <<filters_and_interceptors>>: Handlers renamed to entity
interceptors for clarity (in this log included).
* Section <<global_binding>>: Global binding is now the default for
filters and entity interceptors. The annotation `@GlobalBinding` has
been dropped.
* Section <<priorities>>: Clarified reverse ordering of the response
filter chain based on binding priorities.
* Appendix C: Removed from this version after changes to Chapter
<<filters_and_interceptors>>.
* Chapter "Validation": Moved to an instantiate-then-validate strategy
in which validation of constructor parameters and setters is no longer
supported. Simplified validation process to better align with Bean
Validation 1.1 <<bib16>>. In particular, validation of resource
classes, fields and property getters are all carried out in a single
step.
