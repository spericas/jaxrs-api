[[changes-since-2.0-early-draft-third-edition]]
=== Changes Since 2.0 Early Draft (Third Edition)

* Chapter "Validation": Removed from PR. JAX-RS 2.0 will defer to CDI
for Bean Validation. Only those resource classes that are CDI beans
would be validated.
* <<method_exc>>: Clarified that the steps must be followed in
order and that throwables are propagated to the underlying container
only if they cannot be mapped.
* <<resource_method>>: Added `@OPTIONS` to list.
* <<resource_method_return>>: New note about anonymous inner
classes.
* <<request_matching>>: Allow multiple root resource classes to
share same URI in algorithm. Note changes in output and input of steps 1
and 2, respectively.
* <<message_body_writer>>: Throw new exception
`InternalServerErrorException`.
* <<entity_providers>>: Removed steps that required the use of the
JavaBeans Activation Framework<<bib20>> to map objects to
representations and vice-versa. The EG deemed this feature to be
confusing and not portable across implementations.
* <<standard_entity_providers>>: Support for pre-packaged readers
and writers for Java types `java.lang.Boolean`, `java.lang.Character`,
`java.lang.Number` and media type `text/plain`.
* <<standard_entity_providers>>: Detailed behavior for readers and
zero-length request entities.
* <<dynamic_binding>>: `DynamicBinder` replaced by
`DynamicFeature`.
* <<exceptions_filters_and_interceptors>>: Clarified processing of
responses mapped using exception mappers.
* Chapter <<asynchronous_processing>>: Updated sections related to the
Server API. `@Suspended` annotation, timeouts and callbacks.
* <<timeouts_and_callbacks>>: Throw new exception
`ServiceUnavailableException`.
* <<resource_context>>: New section for `ResourceContext`.
* <<ejbs>>: Clarified location of annotations in accordance to the
JAX-RS annotation inheritance rules.
* <<filters_and_interceptors>>: Replaced `@PostMatching` by
`@PreMatching`. Post-matching is now the default.
* <<annotation_table>>: Edited section on JAX-RS 2.0 annotations.
