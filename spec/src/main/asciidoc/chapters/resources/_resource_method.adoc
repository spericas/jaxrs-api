[[resource_method]]
=== Resource Methods

Resource methods are methods of a resource class annotated with a
request method designator. They are used to handle requests and MUST
conform to certain restrictions described in this section.

A request method designator is a runtime annotation that is annotated
with the `@HttpMethod` annotation. JAX-RS defines a set of request
method designators for the common HTTP methods: `@GET`, `@POST`, `@PUT`,
`@DELETE`, `@PATCH`, `@HEAD` and `@OPTIONS`. Users may define their own
custom request method designators including alternate designators for
the common HTTP methods.

[[visibility]]
==== Visibility

Only `public` methods may be exposed as resource methods. An
implementation SHOULD warn users if a non-`public` method carries a
method designator or `@Path` annotation.

[[resource_method_params]]
==== Parameters

When a resource method is invoked, parameters annotated with
`@FormParam` or one of the annotations listed in Section
[resource_field] are mapped from the request according to the semantics
of the annotation. Similar to fields and bean properties:

* The `DefaultValue` annotation may be used to supply a default value
for parameters
* The `Encoded` annotation may be used to disable automatic URI decoding
of parameter values
* Exceptions thrown during construction of parameter values are treated
the same as exceptions thrown during construction of field or bean
property values, see <<resource_field>>. Exceptions thrown during
construction of `@FormParam` annotated parameter values are treated the
same as if the parameter were annotated with `@HeaderParam`.

[[entity_parameters]]
===== Entity Parameters

The value of a parameter not annotated with `@FormParam` or any of the
annotations listed in in <<resource_field>>, called the entity
parameter, is mapped from the request entity body. Conversion between an
entity body and a Java type is the responsibility of an entity provider,
see <<entity_providers>>. Resource methods MUST have at most one
entity parameter.

[[resource_method_return]]
==== Return Type

Resource methods MAY return `void`, `Response`, `GenericEntity`, or
another Java type, these return types are mapped to a response entity
body as follows:

`void`::
  Results in an empty entity body with a 204 status code.
`Response`::
  Results in an entity body mapped from the entity property of the
  `Response` with the status code specified by the status property of
  the `Response`. A `null` return value results in a 204 status code. If
  the status property of the `Response` is not set: a 200 status code is
  used for a non-`null` entity property and a 204 status code is used if
  the entity property is `null`.
`GenericEntity`::
  Results in an entity body mapped from the `Entity` property of the
  `GenericEntity`. If the return value is not `null` a 200 status code
  is used, a `null` return value results in a 204 status code.
Other::
  Results in an entity body mapped from the class of the returned
  instance or of its type parameter `T` if the return type is
  `CompletionStage<T>` (see <<completionstage>>); if the class is
  an anonymous inner class, its superclass is used instead. If the
  return value is not `null` a 200 status code is used, a `null` return
  value results in a 204 status code.

Methods that need to provide additional metadata with a response should
return an instance of `Response`, the `ResponseBuilder` class provides
a convenient way to create a `Response` instance using a builder
pattern.

Conversion between a Java object and an entity body is the
responsibility of an entity provider, see <<entity_providers>>.
The return type of a resource method and the type of the returned
instance are used to determine the raw type and generic type supplied to
the `isWritable` method of `MessageBodyWriter` as follows:

[id="Table-Determining-raw-and-generic-types-of-return-values", cols="2,3,2,3"]
.Determining raw and generic types of return values
|==================================
|*Return Type*  |*Returned Instance*
usedfootnote:[Or `Entity` property of returned instance if return type is
`Response` or a subclass thereof.]    |*Raw Type*     |*Generic Type*
|`GenericEntity`    |`GenericEntity` or subclass    |`RawType` property
|`Type` property
|`Response` |`GenericEntity` or subclass    |`RawType` property
|`Type` property
|`Response` |`Object` or subclass   |Class of instance |Class of instance
|`Other`    |Return type or subclass    |Class of instance  |Generic type of return type
|==================================

To illustrate the above consider a method that always returns an
instance of `ArrayList<String>` either directly or wrapped in some
combination of `Response` and `GenericEntity`. The resulting raw and
generic types are shown below.

[id="Table-Example-raw-and-generic-types-of-return-values", cols="22,41,21,20"]
.Example raw and generic types of return values
|==================================
|*Return Type*  |*Returned Instance*    |*Raw Type* |*Generic Type
|`GenericEntity`    |`GenericEntity<List<String>>`  |`ArrayList<?>` |`List<String>`
|`Response` |`GenericEntity<List<String>>`  |`ArrayList<?>` |`List<String>`
|`Response` |`ArrayList<String>`    |`ArrayList<?>` |`ArrayList<?>`
|`List<String>` |`ArrayList<String>`    |`ArrayList<?>` |`List<String>`
|==================================

[[method_exc]]
==== Exceptions

A resource method, sub-resource method or sub-resource locator may throw
any checked or unchecked exception. An implementation MUST catch all
exceptions and process them in the following order:

1.  Instances of `WebApplicationException` and its subclasses MUST be
mapped to a response as follows. If the `response` property of the
exception is null, then an
implementation MUST use the most appropriate
exception mapping provider (see <<exceptionmapper>>) to create a new
`Response` instance; otherwise the `response` property is used directly.
The resulting `Response` instance is then processed according to
<<resource_method_return>>.
2. An implementation MUST use the exception mapping provider
(see <<exceptionmapper>>) whose generic type is the nearest
superclass of the exception to create a `Response` instance that is then
processed according to <<resource_method_return>>. If the
exception mapping provider throws an exception while creating a
`Response` then return a server error (status code 500) response to the
client.

[[head_and_options]]
==== HEAD and OPTIONS

`HEAD` and `OPTIONS` requests receive additional automated support. On
receipt of a `HEAD` request an implementation MUST either:

1.  Call a method annotated with a request method designator for `HEAD`
or, if none present,
2.  Call a method annotated with a request method
designator for `GET` and discard any returned entity.

Note that option 2 may result in reduced performance where
entity creation is significant.

On receipt of an `OPTIONS` request an implementation MUST either:

1.  Call a method annotated with a request method designator for
`OPTIONS` or, if none present,
2.  Generate an automatic response using the metadata provided by the
JAX-RS annotations on the matching class and its methods.
