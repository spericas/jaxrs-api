[[sse_client_api]]
=== Client API

The JAX-RSÂ client API for SSE was inspired by the corresponding
JavaScript API in HTML5, but with changes that originate from the use of
a different language. The entry point to the client API is the type
`SseEventSource`, which provides a fluent builder similarly to other
classes in the JAX-RS API. An `SseEventSource` is constructed from a
`WebTarget` that is already configured with a resource location;
`SseEventSource` does not duplicate any functionality in `WebTarget` and
only adds the necessary logic for SSE.

The following example shows how to open an SSE connection and read some
messages for a little while:

[source,java]
----
WebTarget target = client.target("http://...");
try (SseEventSource source = SseEventSource.target(target).build()) {
    source.register(System.out::println);
    source.open();
    Thread.sleep(500); // Consume events for just 500 ms
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
    // falls through
}
----

As seen in this example, an `SseEventSource` implements `AutoCloseable`.
Before opening the source, the client registers an event consumer that
simply prints each event. Additional handlers for other life-cycle
events such as `onComplete` and `onError` are also supported, but for
simplicity only `onEvent` is shown in the example above.
