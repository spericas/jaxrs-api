[[lifecycle]]
=== Lifecycle

By default, just like all the other providers, a single instance of each
filter or entity interceptor is instantiated for each
JAX-RSÂ application. First the constructor is called, then any requested
dependencies are injected, then the appropriate methods are called
(simultaneously) as needed. Implementations MAY offer alternative
lifecycle options beyond the default one. See
<<lifecycle_and_environment>> for additional information.
