[[exceptions_filters_and_interceptors]]
=== Exceptions

[[server-runtime]]
==== Server Runtime

When a filter or interceptor method throws an exception, the server
runtime will process the exception as described in
<<exceptions_providers_server>>. As explained in
<<exceptionmapper>>, a JAX-RS implementation will supply a default
exception mapping provider and an application can supply additional exception mapping
providers. At most one exception mapper MUST be used in a single request
processing cycle to avoid potentially infinite loops.

A response mapped from an exception MUST be processed using the  filter
chain and the  interceptor chain (if an entity is present in the mapped
response). The number of entries in these chains depends on whether a
resource method has been matched or not at the time the exception is
thrown. There are two cases:

1.  If a web resource has been matched before the exception was thrown,
then the filters in  and the interceptors in  will include everything
that has been bound to the method as well as globally;
2.  Otherwise, only global filters and interceptors will
be included.

Note that a filter or interceptor invoked in case 2 will not
have access to resource-dependent information, such as that returned by
an injectable instance of `ResourceInfo`.

[[client-runtime]]
==== Client Runtime

When a filter or interceptor method throws an exception, the client
runtime will process the exception as described in <<exceptions_providers_client>>.
