[[contextprovider]]
=== Context Providers

Context providers supply context to resource classes and other
providers. A context provider class implements the `ContextResolver<T>`
interface and may be annotated with `@Provider` for automatic discovery.
E.g., an application wishing to provide a customized `JAXBContext` to
the default JAXB entity providers would supply a class implementing
`ContextResolver<JAXBContext>`.

Context providers MAY return `null` from the `getContext` method if they
do not wish to provide their context for a particular Java type. E.g. a
JAXB context provider may wish to only provide the context for certain
JAXB classes. Context providers MAY also manage multiple contexts of the
same type keyed to different Java types.

Note that a context provider for JAXB is only applicable in products that
support <<jaxb>>.

[[context_media_type]]
==== Declaring Media Type Capabilities

Context provider implementations MAY restrict the media types they
support using the `@Produces` annotation. The absence of this annotation
is equivalent to its inclusion with media type ("\*/*"), i.e. absence
implies that any media type is supported.

When choosing a context provider an implementation sorts the available
providers according to the media types they declare support for. Sorting
of media types follows the general rule: x/y latexmath:[$<$] x/*
latexmath:[$<$] \*/*, i.e. a provider that explicitly lists a media type
is sorted before a provider that lists \*/*.
