[[default_validation_mode]]
=== Default Validation Mode

According to <<bib16>>, validation is enabled by default only for
the so called _constrained_ methods. Getter methods as defined by the
Java Beans specification are not constrained methods, so they will not
be validated by default. The special annotation `@ValidateOnExecution`
defined in <<bib16>> can be used to selectively enable and disable
validation. For example, you can enable validation on method `getEmail`
shown above as follows:

[source,java]
----
@Path("/")
class MyResourceClass {

    @Email
    @ValidateOnExecution
    public String getEmail() {
        return email;
    }
    ...
}
----

The default value for the `type` attribute of `@ValidateOnExecution` is
`IMPLICIT` which, in the example above, results in method `getEmail`
being validated. See <<bib16>> for more information on other uses
of this annotation.

Note that if validation for getter methods is _enabled_ and a resource
method’s signature obeys the rules for getters, the resource method may
be (unintentionally) invoked during validation. Conversely, if
validation for getter methods is _disabled_ and the _matching_ resource
method’s signature obeys the rules for getters, the JAX-RS runtime will
still validate the method (i.e., the validation preference will be
ignored) before invocation.
