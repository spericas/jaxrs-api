[[publication]]
=== Publication

Applications are published in different ways depending on whether the
application is run in a Java SE environment or within a container. This
section describes the alternate means of publication.

A compliant implementation MUST support both alternatives on Java SE.

[[java-se]]
==== Java SE

There are two alternative ways of publishing on Java SE:
Creating SE endpoints directly or using the SE bootstrap API.
Both are described in this section.

[[se-endpoint]]
===== Java SE Endpoint

In a Java SE environment a configured instance of an endpoint class can
be obtained using the `createEndpoint` method of `RuntimeDelegate`. The
application supplies an instance of `Application` and the type of
endpoint required. An implementation MAY support zero or more endpoint
types of any desired type.

How the resulting endpoint class instance is used to publish the
application is outside the scope of this specification.

[[jax-ws]]
====== JAX-WS

An implementation that supports publication via JAX-WS MUST support
`createEndpoint` with an endpoint type of `jakarta.xml.ws.Provider`.
JAX-WS describes how a `Provider` based endpoint can be published in an
SE environment.

[[se-bootstrap]]
===== Java SE Bootstrap

This is the RECOMMENDED way of publishing an application on Java SE,
as the bootstrapping code is completely portable across vendors and products.

In a Java SE environment an application can be published using an embedded
HTTP server bootstrapped by the implementation. An application invokes
`SeBootstrap.start(app, config)` with an implementation of `Application`
and a configuration built by calling `build()` on a configuration builder.

The builder is created by `SeBootstrap.Configuration.builder()` and assembles
all information needed to configure the embedded HTTP server using properties.
A compliant implementation MUST support all properties explicitly defined by
`SeBootstrap.Configuration`, but MAY support additional properties using a
product-specific namespace prefix.

====== Reserved Namespace `jakarta`

The namespace prefix `jakarta` is reserved
and MUST NOT be extended by vendors, but only by future revisions of the
Jakarta RESTful Web Services API, Javadoc and / or specification.

[[servlet]]
==== Servlet

A JAX-RS application is packaged as a Web application in a `.war` file.
The application classes are packaged in `WEB-INF/classes` or
`WEB-INF/lib` and required libraries are packaged in `WEB-INF/lib`. See
the Servlet specification for full details on packaging of web
applications.

It is RECOMMENDED that implementations support the Servlet 3 framework
pluggability mechanism to enable portability between containers and to
avail themselves of container-supplied class scanning facilities. When
using the pluggability mechanism the following conditions MUST be met:

* If _no_ `Application` subclass is present, JAX-RS implementations are
REQUIRED to dynamically add a servlet and set its name to
+
`jakarta.ws.rs.core.Application`
+
and to automatically discover all root resource classes and providers
which MUST be packaged with the application. Additionally, the
application MUST be packaged with a `web.xml` that specifies a servlet
mapping for the added servlet. An example of such a `web.xml` file is:

[source,xml]
----
<web-app version="3.0" xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee
        http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_3_0.xsd">
    <servlet>
        <servlet-name>jakarta.ws.rs.core.Application</servlet-name>
    </servlet>
    <servlet-mapping>
        <servlet-name>jakarta.ws.rs.core.Application</servlet-name>
        <url-pattern>/myresources/*</url-pattern>
    </servlet-mapping>
</web-app>
----

* If an `Application` subclass is present:
** If there is already a servlet that handles this application. That is,
a servlet that has an initialization parameter named
+
`jakarta.ws.rs.Application`
+
whose value is the fully qualified name of the `Application` subclass,
then no additional configuration steps are required by the JAX-RS
implementation.
** If _no_ servlet handles this application, JAX-RS implementations are
REQUIRED to dynamically add a servlet whose fully qualified name must be
that of the `Application` subclass. If the `Application` subclass is
annotated with `@ApplicationPath`, implementations are REQUIRED to use
the value of this annotation appended with "/*" to define a mapping
for the added server. Otherwise, the application MUST be packaged with a
`web.xml` that specifies a servlet mapping. For example, if
`org.example.MyApplication` is the name of the `Application` subclass, a
sample `web.xml` would be:

[source,xml]
----
<web-app version="3.0" xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee
        http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_3_0.xsd">
    <servlet>
        <servlet-name>org.example.MyApplication</servlet-name>
    </servlet>
    <servlet-mapping>
        <servlet-name>org.example.MyApplication</servlet-name>
        <url-pattern>/myresources/*</url-pattern>
    </servlet-mapping>
</web-app>
----

When an `Application` subclass is present in the archive, if both
`Application.getClasses` and `Application.getSingletons` return an empty
collection then all root resource classes and providers packaged in the
web application MUST be included and the JAX-RS implementation is
REQUIRED to discover them automatically by scanning a `.war` file as
described above. If either `getClasses` or `getSingletons` returns a
non-empty collection then only those classes or singletons returned MUST
be included in the published JAX-RS application.

The following table summarizes the Servlet 3 framework pluggability
mechanism:

[id="Table-Summary-of-Servlet-3-framework-pluggability-cases", cols="24,14,39,31"]
.Summary of Servlet 3 framework pluggability cases
|==================================
|*Condition*    |*Action*   |*Servlet Name*     |*web.xml*
|No `Application` subclass   |Add servlet    |`jakarta.ws.rs.core.Application`
|Required for servlet mapping
|`Application` subclass handled by existing servlet |(none) |(already defined)
|Not required
|`Application` subclass _not_ handled by existing servlet   |Add servlet
|Subclass name  |If no `@ApplicationPath` then required for servlet mapping
|==================================

If not using the Servlet 3 framework pluggability mechanism (e.g. in a
pre-Servlet 3.0 container), the `servlet-class` or `filter-class`
element of the `web.xml` descriptor SHOULD name the
JAX-RS implementation-supplied servlet or filter class respectively. The
`Application` subclass SHOULD be identified using an `init-param` with a
`param-name` of `jakarta.ws.rs.Application`.

Note that the Servlet 3 framework pluggability mechanism described above
is based on servlets and not filters. Applications that prefer to use an
implementation-supplied filter class must use the pre-Servlet 3.0
configuration mechanism.

[[other-container]]
==== Other Container

An implementation MAY provide facilities to host a JAX-RS application in
other types of container, such facilities are outside the scope of this
specification.
